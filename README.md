# Self-Driving Car Simulation using TensorFlow and Keras

This project involves training a neural network for a self-driving car simulation using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset obtained from a car simulator, and the trained model can be used to drive a virtual car within the simulation.

# Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed:
```
Python 
TensorFlow 
Keras
imgaug 
OpenCV

```


# Setup
-----
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:udacity/self-driving-car-sim.git

```

Update system packages:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
Download and preprocess the dataset:

# Create and Activate the virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

```
# Run the simulation
exectute the file that is cloned from udacity simulator

# Run the automation file
python drive.py
